# Day 1 Notes

## 9-10am Zoom

Techniques of cybersecurity

Red team / blue team:

- red team attempts to attack systems (approved by organization)
- blue team attempts to secure systems

Discovery:

- network mapping: finding IP addresses
- port scanning: finding open ports on a machine
  - port = number (like 22) for a specific software (like SSH) on a machine
- phishing: fake email and login page for finding out passwords, etc.
- password cracking: reverse engineering hashed passwords
- vulnerability enumeration: looking in public databases for vulnerable software
  - CVE: common vulnerabilities and exposures
  - 0-day exploit: the exploit is released before the fix
    - 3-day exploit: the exploit is released 3 days after the fix
- fuzzing: generating random/bad data to see if it breaks things

Attacks:

- exploiting CVEs
- DDOS: distributed denial of service
- MITM: man in the middle
- Rootkits and trojans
- Viruses
- XSS: cross-site scripting
- SQL injection: hijacking a database

Defense:

- Hiding open ports (firewalls)
- Updating software
- Training people: prevent phishing
- Good password hashing
- Encryption
- Antivirus
